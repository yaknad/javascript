cli:
run project: ng serve
create component: ng generate component X

angular flow:
*************
Angular CLI (running by ng-serve) builds js bundles and injects them in the bottom of the index.html file (as seen in "view source" in the browser).
The first code to run is main.ts. It bootstraps (starts) the app by passing the AppModule.
AppModule, in its "bootstrap" field, tells angular which components should be familiar when bootstarping.
(main.ts -> points to module -> points to components).
Inside app.component, there's a "selector" field that tells angular to replace the app-root tag with the app.component.html template.
-   We can have multiple custom html tags like "root-app" (root-app2 etc.) in index-html, register multiple components to AppModule's bootstrap field and 
    configure each component's selector to it's own html tag. If mulitple components will be configured to the same html-tag, the last one in AggModule
    bootstrap list will be taken. After that being said, the best practice is to have a single root component (app.component) and nest all other components in it.

angular.json:
*************
configures the CLI project
after installing "bootstrap", add bootstrap's css file in angular.json's section: architect.build.styles:
"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" (put it before the global styles.css, so it's possible to override bootstrap in the global css)

typescript:
***********
@Component - it's a Typescript decorator. Are these like attributes in C#/Java?

to enable binding:
on app.module.ts FormsModule and add it to NgModule.imports
1 way binding - {{ fieldName }}
2 way binding - <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="fieldName">

components:
***********
- Custom code goes under the app folder. Best practice is to name a folder after the component's name.
- Component file's name will be in the structure of: name.component.ts
- when adding a component make sure it is registered in the @NgModule (when adding using the cli, it will be added automatically)
- Componenet MUST have a "templateUrl" or a "template" value (selector and styles are optional). When using inline "template", we can use `` instead of '' to enable multiline templates.
- Similar to templates, we can use StylesUrl or Styles (for inline styles - use `` instread of '' for multiline). Styles/Url gets an array of styles!
- The Selector property can use css-selectors by element (selector: custom-tag-name), by attribute (selector:[custom-attribute-name]) or by class. 
(selector: .custom-class). In order to use the attribute or class selector that are Kebab-cased (aa-bbb), use `` instead of ''. 
id or pseudo (like :hover) will not work. Recomendation is to use the by element way.
