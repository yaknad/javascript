Unit Testing:
*************
* JASMINE - js tests library, reuqires a runner, like Karama. jasmine-node already have a built in runner. async tests suported from jasmine 2.x. Has mocking support (vs. Sinon).
* MOCHA - JavaScript test framework (like Jasmine but supports async tests) running on both Node.js (no need for browser) and in the browser. 
Has built-in runner (no need for karma), but it can also be used as a framework only, and let Karma do the running. 
Uses assretion libraries like Chai, should.js, expect.js, better-assert.js.
* KARMA - js unit tests runner. runs on all browsers, with all testing frameworks (jasmine, mocha etc.). get a report of tests run. 
Supports CI servers. Doesn't have a built in watcher support (?). doesn't have built in mocking support (use Sinon).
* SINON - mocking library for js testing frameworks. It also has a fake server capabilities.
