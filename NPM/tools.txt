Unit Testing:
*************
JASMINE - js tests library (newer than qunit). reuqires a runner, like Karama (or Chutzpah), but jasmine-node already have a built in runner. asyn tests suported from jasmine 2.x.
          Has mocking support (vs. Sinon).
MOCHA - JavaScript test framework (like Jasmine but supports async tests) running on Node.js (no need for browser here) and in the browser (in-browser -> vs. Karma, 
        but it can also be used as a framework only, and let Karma do the running). Uses assretion libraries like Chai, should.js, expect.js, better-assert.js.
KARMA - js unit tests runner. runs on all browsers, with all testing frameworks (jasmine, mocha etc.). get a report of tests run. supports CI servers. 
        doesn't have a built in watcher support (?). doesn't have built in mocking support (use Sinon).
SINON - mocking library for js testing frameworks. It also has a fake server capabilities.
